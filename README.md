# Module Challenge - Refactor Code - Horiseon

## Description
This project is to modify the webpage for Horiseon, a marketing agency, in order for better accessibility standards. 

The starter code loaded with no errors. However, it did not follow the semantic structure of HTML. To increase the readability for both developers and the browser, all tags have been changed to semantic HTML tags.

Despite its detailed and accurate formatting in starter code, I noticed both the HTML page and the stylesheet can be tidier after changing the tags and class attributes. So their styles can be adjusted in groups, in case for future modification. This helps if the company decides to update their appearance without distorting the sections within the same category.

What I learned from this project is that I can use #id to jump to the section on the same page. It helps me understand and differentiate class/id better, which leads to the thought of working on a ‘back to top’ button in my next project.
